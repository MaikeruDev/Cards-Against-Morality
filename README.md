# Cards Against Morality

Welcome to **Cards Against Morality**, the game that takes everything you thought you knew about Morality, morality, and good taste and shits all over it. If you’re easily offended, fuck off now because this game isn’t for you.

## Overview

**Cards Against Morality** is a party game for horrible people. Unlike other party games you’ve played before, **Cards Against Morality** is as despicable and awkward as you and your fucked-up friends.

### How to Play

1. **Setup**: Each player draws ten white answer cards. These are your weapons of mass disruption.
2. **Starting the Game**: The person who most recently took a dump begins as the Card Czar and plays a black question card.
3. **Answering**: Everyone else answers the question or fills in the blank by passing one white card, face down, to the Card Czar.
4. **Judging**: The Card Czar shuffles all the answers and reads each card combination aloud for the group. Hold onto your seats, because shit’s about to get wild.
5. **Winning the Round**: The Card Czar picks the funniest answer, and whoever submitted it gets one point. After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar, and everyone draws back up to ten white cards.
6. **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach an agreed-upon number of points wins the game and the unofficial title of "Biggest Asshole."

### Rules
